# Code
This is a typical data table. I used JavaScript to add sequential numbering in the first cell of each row in order to get the count of total players. 

The benefit of the sequential numbering code is that if a player is deleted or added, you don't have to manually update the numbers. If one player is added or removed, especially at the top of the table, you'd have to manually update the entire sequence. With the sequential numbering code, you can make any changes as needed and JavaScript will take care of the numbering.
